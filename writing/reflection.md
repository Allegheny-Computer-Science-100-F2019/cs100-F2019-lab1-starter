Docker is Dynamite.
Gradle is Great.
Hello, World.
~~~

## For each Gradle command, add an explanation to the following list

- `gradle build`: builds a container to run code in
- `gradle run`: runs your code and displays output
- `gradle grade`: grades your assignment and gives you a checklist of what is and isn't done

## What was the greatest technical challenge that you faced and how did you overcome it?

After much struggle, I’ve discovered why Gradle was not working: first of all, PowerShell is stupid. I had thought it was working but it
was not, as it was inside of the wrong folder. I also did not realize I HAD cmd, but once I did, I discovered that it works much better and
makes me much less angry. As it turns out, my files downloaded into the folder that PowerShell doesn’t automatically run in, so all of my
hours of effort were futile. After that, I discovered that my computer didn’t like the “$(pwd)” and “$HOME” functions, so I had to type out
the entire file path by hand, in a very particular format. After about 30 minutes, I finally had Gradle running. After that, I had
difficulty understanding the details of how to use the various Gradle commands, because at this point, I was almost 2 whole assignments
behind everyone else, and they didn't have time to help me. I just used trial-and-error, and kept running things in different orders until
it graded my work and ran my code.

## After completing this assignment, what is task that you want to practice more? Why?

I want to practice writing code more, and interpreting the outputs I get. I feel like understanding what I'm doing wrong on a technical
level would help me move along faster, and not fall behind so much.

## After completing this assignment, what is one experience for which you are grateful?

 I am grateful to have experienced so much support from my classmates throughout this whole process. I've been getting advice from the
people around me, as well as some awesome technical leaders. Hannah met with me outside of her office hours just to help me figure out
gradle. I can't imagine what I would have done without her. I'm also glad that I found out early that PowerShell doesn't do what I want it
to do, so that I don't fall further and further behind.
